### 1. **Breaking Down Work into Fibers**
   - **Fiber** is a data structure that represents a unit of work. Every component in a React application is associated with a Fiber node.
   - Fibers hold all the information about the component, including its type, props, state, and effects. They also track the work that needs to be done to update that component.

### 2. **Incremental Rendering**
   - React Fiber allows React to break down rendering into smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of trying to update the entire component tree in one go (which could block the main thread and make the UI unresponsive), Fiber lets React pause work and continue it later.
   - This incremental rendering means React can interleave rendering with other tasks, like responding to user input, ensuring that the app remains responsive even during heavy updates.

### 3. **Prioritization**
   - One of the key features of Fiber is its ability to prioritize different tasks. React can decide which updates are more important (like user interactions) and work on those first, while less critical tasks (like updating a background process) can be delayed.
   - Fiber uses a scheduler to manage this prioritization, ensuring that high-priority tasks are handled promptly.

### 4. **Work-in-Progress and Current Fibers**
   - React Fiber keeps track of two versions of each component: the current version (what’s on the screen) and a work-in-progress version (the new version being prepared).
   - When React begins working on an update, it creates a new Fiber tree based on the current tree, making changes as needed. Once the work-in-progress tree is complete, it replaces the current tree, and the updates are flushed to the screen.

### 5. **Reconciliation with Fiber**
   - Reconciliation is the process of comparing the new Fiber tree (work-in-progress) with the current tree to figure out what changes need to be made to the DOM.
   - Fiber makes this process more efficient by reusing components that haven’t changed, reducing the amount of work needed to update the UI.

### 6. **Concurrency**
   - Although Fiber itself doesn’t introduce true concurrency (like running tasks in parallel), it lays the groundwork for **Concurrent Mode** in React. 
   - Concurrent Mode allows React to work on multiple tasks at the same time and decide which tasks to finish first based on their priority.

### 7. **Handling Updates**
   - When an update is triggered (like a change in state or props), React Fiber creates a new work-in-progress Fiber tree.
   - The Fiber scheduler decides how to handle the update: whether to perform it immediately, pause it, or delay it based on the priority.
   - Once React has finished building the new Fiber tree, it commits the changes, updating the actual DOM and flushing the new UI to the screen.

### 8. **Commit Phase**
   - After the reconciliation and work-in-progress phase, React enters the **commit phase**, where it applies the changes to the DOM.
   - This phase is synchronous and involves tasks like updating the DOM nodes, running lifecycle methods, and ensuring that everything is in sync.

### 9. **Alternates and Cloning**
   - React Fiber uses a concept called "alternates." When React updates a component, it checks if the component already has a work-in-progress Fiber. If it does, React reuses it; otherwise, it clones the current Fiber to create the work-in-progress Fiber.
   - This cloning helps optimize memory usage and makes the update process more efficient.

### **Summary**
React Fiber works by breaking down the rendering and updating processes into smaller units of work (Fibers), allowing React to manage these tasks efficiently, prioritize important updates, and keep the application responsive. It’s a flexible architecture that enhances React’s performance and lays the groundwork for advanced features like Concurrent Mode, making it well-suited for building complex, interactive user interfaces.
### **React (Pre-Fiber)**
- **Original Reconciliation Algorithm**: Before Fiber, React used a simpler reconciliation algorithm that updated the DOM in a synchronous, top-down manner. This approach was efficient for small to medium-sized applications but had limitations with large or complex apps.
- **Synchronous Rendering**: The original React would try to complete rendering of the entire component tree in a single pass. If rendering took too long, it could block the main thread, causing the UI to freeze or become unresponsive.
- **Single Stack Frame**: The original React used a single stack frame to perform updates. If an update was started, React had to complete the entire update before responding to anything else, which could result in poor performance during heavy rendering tasks.





### **React Fiber**
- **New Reconciliation Algorithm**: React Fiber is a complete rewrite of the reconciliation algorithm. It breaks down the rendering work into units of "work," allowing React to pause and resume work as needed. This makes it more flexible and capable of handling complex updates.
- **Incremental Rendering**: With Fiber, React can update the component tree incrementally, rather than all at once. This means it can prioritize important updates (like user input) and delay less critical updates, leading to a smoother user experience.
- **Concurrency**: React Fiber introduces the concept of concurrency, allowing React to interrupt rendering to handle more urgent updates. For example, if a user interacts with the UI while React is rendering a complex component, Fiber can pause the rendering, handle the user interaction, and then resume rendering.
- **Two-Fiber Model**: In React Fiber, each component can have two Fiber nodes: the current one (what’s on the screen) and a work-in-progress (the version being updated). This dual structure allows React to manage updates more efficiently.
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Despite the major changes under the hood, React Fiber maintains compatibility with the existing React API. This means developers didn't need to change how they wrote React code to benefit from Fiber.

### **Key Differences**
- **Rendering Process**: The original React architecture used synchronous, single-pass rendering, while React Fiber uses asynchronous, incremental rendering that can be paused and resumed.
- **Performance**: React Fiber is more performant, especially in complex applications. It allows React to be more responsive to user interactions, even while updates are in progress.
- **Prioritization**: React Fiber allows React to prioritize updates based on their importance, which was not possible with the original architecture.
- **Concurrency and Flexibility**: Fiber's architecture supports concurrency, meaning React can handle multiple tasks simultaneously, making it more flexible and responsive.

### **Conclusion**
React Fiber is essentially the evolution of React, addressing the limitations of the original architecture. It brings improved performance, responsiveness, and flexibility, particularly in complex applications. While the API remains largely the same, Fiber's under-the-hood improvements make React a more powerful and efficient tool for modern web development.

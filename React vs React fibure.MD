### **React (Pre-Fiber)**
- **Original Reconciliation Algorithm**: Before Fiber, React used a simpler reconciliation algorithm that updated the DOM in a synchronous, top-down manner. This approach was efficient for small to medium-sized applications but had limitations with large or complex apps.
- **Synchronous Rendering**: The original React would try to complete rendering of the entire component tree in a single pass. If rendering took too long, it could block the main thread, causing the UI to freeze or become unresponsive.
- **Single Stack Frame**: The original React used a single stack frame to perform updates. If an update was started, React had to complete the entire update before responding to anything else, which could result in poor performance during heavy rendering tasks.

### **React Fiber**
- **New Reconciliation Algorithm**: React Fiber is a complete rewrite of the reconciliation algorithm. It breaks down the rendering work into units of "work," allowing React to pause and resume work as needed. This makes it more flexible and capable of handling complex updates.
- **Incremental Rendering**: With Fiber, React can update the component tree incrementally, rather than all at once. This means it can prioritize important updates (like user input) and delay less critical updates, leading to a smoother user experience.
- **Concurrency**: React Fiber introduces the concept of concurrency, allowing React to interrupt rendering to handle more urgent updates. For example, if a user interacts with the UI while React is rendering a complex component, Fiber can pause the rendering, handle the user interaction, and then resume rendering.
- **Two-Fiber Model**: In React Fiber, each component can have two Fiber nodes: the current one (whatâ€™s on the screen) and a work-in-progress (the version being updated). This dual structure allows React to manage updates more efficiently.
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Despite the major changes under the hood, React Fiber maintains compatibility with the existing React API. This means developers didn't need to change how they wrote React code to benefit from Fiber.

### **Key Differences**
- **Rendering Process**: The original React architecture used synchronous, single-pass rendering, while React Fiber uses asynchronous, incremental rendering that can be paused and resumed.
- **Performance**: React Fiber is more performant, especially in complex applications. It allows React to be more responsive to user interactions, even while updates are in progress.
- **Prioritization**: React Fiber allows React to prioritize updates based on their importance, which was not possible with the original architecture.
- **Concurrency and Flexibility**: Fiber's architecture supports concurrency, meaning React can handle multiple tasks simultaneously, making it more flexible and responsive.

### **Conclusion**
React Fiber is essentially the evolution of React, addressing the limitations of the original architecture. It brings improved performance, responsiveness, and flexibility, particularly in complex applications. While the API remains largely the same, Fiber's under-the-hood improvements make React a more powerful and efficient tool for modern web development.
